<p>India has an internet user base of over 100 million users. The penetration of e-commerce is low compared to markets like the United States and the United Kingdom but is growing at a much faster rate with a large number of new entrants. The industry consensus is that growth is at an inflection point with key drivers being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing broadband Internet (growing at 20% MoM) and 3G penetration.</li>
<li>Rising standards of living and a burgeoning, upwardly mobile middle class with high disposable incomes</li>
<li>Availability of much wider product range (including long tail and Direct Imports) compared to what is available at brick and mortar retailers</li>
<li>Busy lifestyles, urban traffic congestion and lack of time for offline shopping</li>
<li>Lower prices compared to brick and mortar retail driven by disintermediation and reduced inventory and real estate costs</li>
</ul>
